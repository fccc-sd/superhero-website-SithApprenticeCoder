                    A Sith Holocron is a powerful artifact from the Old Republic era.
                    They were highly sought by mainly the Sith, bit also Bounty Hunters,
                    fallen Jedi, and other beings that wanted power. Everyone that fits 
                    the type wanted a Holocron so bad, but it was very hard to get. They 
                    were so hard to get that the only Sith to get one in over 1000 years 
                    is your character in a game on Steam &trade; called Star Wars &trade;
                    The Old Republic. You can choose to be many things in that game, but 
                    if you want the Sith Holocron, you have to choose the path of the Sith.
                    They could vary from the tip of a pyramid to the size of your palm. 
                    An example of someone who had handsized Sith Holocrons was <em>Darth Vader</em>. 
                    After Vader had been left to die on Mustafar, formerly Anakin, <em>Palpatine</em>
                    created a robotic suit for him and put a Sith Holocron in each of his hands.
                    This was so Vader would be very powerful, but the damage was already done. 
                    After Anakin had his arms and legs chopped off, he lost a lot of power due 
                    to losing a ton of cells with missing limbs and 3rd to 4th degree burns throughout 
                    his outer and internal body. The Sith Holocrons in his hands did help a lot
                    because it allowed him to use <em>The Force</em> better than he ever could.
                    Specifically better than he could without them. Due to him not having hands, the force was 
                    very hard to use. He could still use <em>The Force</em>, but it was harder 
                    without the Holocrons boosting his power. One big thing the Holocrons along with 
                    him being <em>The Chosen One</em> did was allow him to go into the force. This 
                    version of Vader is called the <em>Dark Dimensions Vader</em>. This vader was the 
                    most powerful version of himself. he grew back his limbs temporarily and 
                    "defeated" Yoda, Obi Wan, Mace Windu, and many other Jedi all at once with ease.
                    As seen in the picture on the bottom left, he had 2 lightsaber blades
                    that had no hilt. He was very powerful thanks to the Holocrons, the 
                    Sith, and his abilities as <em>The Chosen One</em>.
