            <h2 class="important">What Were Anakin's Powers?</h2>
            
                <p>
                    <strong>Anakin's</strong> powers were obtained when he was born, 
                    but learned how to use them better and with more efficiency as he grew.
                    He was trained every day for about 13 years (32bby-19bby) and grew
                    more powerful with every day he practiced. He also learned how to wield 
                    a lightsaber during this time, but the lightsaber is only the weapon of the 
                    Force Users. He learned the ways of the Force throughout his time with the Jedi, but 
                    had to have a Sith <em>Holocron</em> implanted in both of his robot hands so he could 
                    still use the force.
                </p>

                <br>

            <h2 class="important">How Did Anakin Get These Powers?</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Anakin</strong> obtained his powers when he was born on Tatooine. 
                    After he had been taken by the Jedi so he could trained by the Jedi. With the 
                    Jedi teaching him, he grew very powerful very quickly. He would then go on to become 
                    <strong>Darth Vader</strong> and then, in the end, redeeming himself as the man he once was 
                    and dying for his son, <strong>Luke Skywalker</strong>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>

            <h2 class="important">How Powerful Was Anakin?</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Anakin</strong> was a very powerful Jedi and Sith, but he got weaker after 
                    falling to the Dark Side. On the Jedi side, he ranks 1/30 out of all the Jedi to ever exist
                    because he was <em>The Chosen One</em>. On the Sith side, he ranks 4/30 out of all Jedi.
                    Getting his arms and legs cut off and then being burnt made him a lot less powerful, with the 
                    restrictions of his suit, too.
