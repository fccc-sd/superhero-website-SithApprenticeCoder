            <h2 class="important">What Were Anakin's Powers?</h2>
            
                <p>
                    <strong>Anakin's</strong> powers were obtained when he was born, <br>
                    but learned how to use them better and with more efficiency as he grew. <br>
                    He was trained every day for about 13 years (32bby-19bby) and grew <br>
                    more powerful with every day he practiced. He also learned how to wield <br>
                    a lightsaber during this time, but the lightsaber is only the weapon of the <br>
                    Force Users. He learned the ways of the Force throughout his time with the Jedi, but <br>
                    had to have a Sith <strong>Holocron</strong> implanted in both of his robot hands so he could <br>
                    still use the force.

            <h2 class="important">How Did Anakin Get These Powers?</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Anakin</strong> obtained his powers when he was born on Tatooine. <br>
                    After he had been taken by the Jedi so he could trained by the Jedi. With the <br>
                    Jedi teaching him, he grew very powerful very quickly. He would then go on to become <br>
                    <strong>Darth Vader</strong> and then, in the end, redeem himself as the man he once was <br>
                    and dying for his son, <strong>Luke Skywalker</strong>, to end the Sith. <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>

            <h2 class="important">How Powerful Was Anakin?</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Anakin</strong> was a very powerful Jedi and Sith, but he got weaker after <br>
                    falling to the Dark Side. On the Jedi side, he ranks 1/30 out of all the Jedi to ever exist <br>
                    because he was <strong>The Chosen One</strong>. On the Sith side, he ranks 4/30 out of all the Sith. <br>
                    Getting his arms and legs cut off and then being burnt made him a lot less powerful, with the <br>
                    restrictions of his suit, too. <strong>Palpatine</strong> made his suit this way so he didn't have to worry <br>
                    about being killed and it caused <strong>Vader</strong> immense pain because it's <br>
                    supposed to make him angrier, which in turn makes him more powerful, but this was another <br>
                    one of <strong>Palpatine's</strong> lies so he could control him. If anything, it just caused him to go insane <br>
                    and get angry because of the pain, but not in the way <strong>Palpatine</strong> said. <br>
