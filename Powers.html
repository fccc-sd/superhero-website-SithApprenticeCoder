            <h2>What Were Dooku's Powers?</h2>
            
                <p>
                    <strong>Count Dooku's</strong> powers were obtained when he was born, 
                    but learned how to use them better and with more efficiency as he grew.
                    He was trained every day for about 26-36 years and grew
                    more powerful with every day he practiced. He also learned how to wield 
                    a lightsaber during this time, but the lightsaber is only the weapon of the 
                    Force Users. He learned the ways of the Force throughout his time with the Jedi, but 
                    learned how to use Force Lightning with the Sith later on down the road.
                </p>

            <h2>How Did Dooku Get These Powers?</h2>

                <p>
                    When <strong>Dooku</strong> was born, the <strong>Midichlorians</strong>
                    in his blood determined how sensitive and powerful he was with the Force.
                    These <strong>Midichlorians</strong> are in every cell of the body and go through the blood
                    which means just by testing the blood, anyone can tell how many 
                    <strong>Midichlorians</strong> you or anyone else has. The more you have, the more 
                    powerful you are. The highest count was 23,500 <strong>Midichlorians</strong> and this 
                    character was <strong>Palpatine</strong> himself, but he isn't who we're talking about right now. In summary, 
                    <strong>Dooku</strong> was born with his Force sensitivity and just learned how to 
                    use it better as he trained.
                </p>

            <h2>How Powerful Was Dooku?</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Dooku</strong> was a very powerful Jedi and Sith, but he was not the 
                    most powerful. On the Jedi list, he ranks 16 out of 30 and on the Sith list, 
                    he ranks 18 out of 30. He is up there and, for a Sith, he lived a really 
                    long time. Sith are usually killed at a younger age, but he was able to live 
                    a long life of 83 years old.
