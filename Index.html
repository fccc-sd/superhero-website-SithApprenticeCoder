            <h2>A Little Intro to Count Dooku</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Count Dooku</strong> was not always a Sith.
                    He was a Jedi at one point and was trained by <strong>Yoda</strong>. 
                    His real name isn't <stong>Dooku</stong>, but is actually
                    <strong>Tyranus</strong>. Later down the road, he found some things
                    that he didn't like and killed a Jedi Master named <strong>Yaddle</strong> who 
                    is believed by a few <strong>Star Wars &trade;</strong> fans is <strong>Yaddle</strong> was
                    <strong>Yoda's</strong> wife and they had <strong>Grogu</strong> together, so 
                    that's why <strong>Yoda</strong> doesn't like <strong>Dooku</strong>. 
                    After killing <strong>Yaddle</strong>, he left the order and then <strong>Palpatine</strong> 
                    came to him with a deal no one could resist, so he joined the Sith at that point. 
                    No one knows when that was, but with the shows and movies, we can take a guess that he didnt
                    start doing things with the Sith until <strong>Attack of the Clones &trade;</strong>, 
                    meaning he couldv'e turned to the Sith between Episode 1 and Episode 2 or before Episode 1.
                    Nobody really knows, but the fandom can theorize about it until they inevitably
                    make a show or movie on <strong>Count Dooku</strong>.
