            <h2 class="important">A Little Intro to Anakin</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Anakin</strong> was not always a Sith. He was a Jedi at one point and was 
                    trained by <strong>Obi Wan</strong>. He was born on Tatooine by his mom, <strong>Shmi Skywalker</strong>, 
                    even though she did not have a partner. Anakin was hoped by many to me <em>The Chosen One</em> because of 
                    an old prophecy that said <em>The Chosen One</em> would bring and end to the Sith and bring balance to the Force. 
                    They thought he was <em>The Chosen One</em> because the prophecy also said they would be born with no father, and <strong>Anakin</strong>
                    was born without a father and seemingly was a miracle to <strong>Shmi</strong>. He then went on to train as a Jedi before being manipulated by 
                    <strong>Palpatine</strong> into joining the Dark side with the promise he could save the ones he loved. A few eeks prior to this, he 
                    had visions of his wife, <strong>Padme Amidala</strong>, dying during child birth. He claimed that he wasn't going to let the same 
                    thing happen to her when talking about the same thing happened with his mom. In the end, he ended up getting all his limbs cut off, 
                    left to burn or the shores of <em>Mustafar</em>, and ended up contributing to the death of <strong>Padme</strong>. He then became 
                    <strong>Darth Vader</strong>, ruling under <strong>Palpatine</strong> for 23-24 years. He then saw his son, <strong>Luke Skywalker</strong>
                    being tortured by <strong>Palpatine's</strong> devastating Force lightning, so he picked <strong>Palpatine</strong> up and threw 
                    him into a Reactor Shaft, killing both <strong>Palpatine</strong> and himself in the process, but ultimately saving his son and 
                    bringing balance to the Force.
