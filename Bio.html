            <h2>About Count Dooku</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Count Dooku</strong> may look like he is a misunderstood
                    humanoid who lost his way, but he is so much worse. He was a very racist
                    character and he planned a whole mass extinction after <strong>The Clone Wars</strong> 
                    had ended on all species except humanoid. During the War, he would capture planets
                    and cut off all their resources just to make them suffer. He would take their valuables, 
                    families, and kill for fun. He would ask for the help of some systems for the 
                    <strong>Seperatist</strong> party, but then leave them stranded or just kill them 
                    with no hesitation. He was ultimately terminated by <strong>Anakin Skywalker</strong> near 
                    the end of <strong>The Clone Wars</strong>, but it was all in <strong>Palpatine's</strong> master 
                    plan.

            <h2>Count Dooku's Origins</h2>
            <!--Fix these TBDs and out of place text-->
                <p>
                    <strong>Count Dooku</strong> was found as a child with Force sensitivity on TBD.
                    He was then taken back with the Jedi and trained under <strong>Yoda</strong> and 
                    sometimes <strong>Yaddle</strong>. He was trained all the way until he became a 
                    Jedi Knight and started learning other things he didn't think felt right about the 
                    Jedi. He argued with his Masters and, in the end, defeated <strong>Yaddle</strong>. 
                    He then left the order where <strong>Palpatine</strong> then found him and gave 
                    him an offer. The offer is unknown right now and I will change this if I learn more, but 
                    he ultimately joined <strong>Palpatine</strong>. He then was there the entirety of 
                    <strong>The Clone Wars</strong> and at the end, he was killed after an intense duel 
                    against <strong>Anakin</strong> and <strong>Obi Wan</strong>. He was able to knock 
                    <strong>Obi Wan</strong> out, but that made <strong>Anakin</strong> angry and was fueled
                    by his rage to win the duel, decapitation Dooku in the end with the manipulation
                    of <strong>Palpatine</strong>. Just as he had fallen from the Jedi with manipulation, he 
                    was killed by that same manipulation from the same person.
