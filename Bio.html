            <h2 class="important">About Anakin</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Anakin</strong> was a young boy who was born without a father and, by what <strong>Shmi</strong>
                    would call him, a miracle baby. He was prophesized to be <em>The Chosen One</em> and the most powerful 
                    Jedi to ever live. He fulfilled the prophecy in Episode 6 when he killed <strong>Palpatine</strong> and
                    by doing that, brought balance to the Force and ended Sith rule throughout the galaxy.

            <h2 class="important">Anakin's Origins</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Anakin</strong> was found as a child with Force sensitivity on <em>Tatooine</em>.
                    He was then taken back with the Jedi and trained under <strong>Obi Wan Kenobi</strong> and,  
                    for a while, <strong>Qui Gon Jinn</strong>. He was trained all the way until he became a 
                    Jedi Knight and started thinking the Jedi weren't what they once were. Along with fear, he 
                    joined the Dark side and went on to live until the collapse of the Empire, which he had 
                    contributed to by killing <strong>Palpatine</strong>, also bringing balance to the Force and
                    fulfilling the prophecy.
