            <h2 class="important">A Little Intro to Anakin</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Anakin</strong> was not always a Sith. He was a Jedi at one point and was <br>
                    trained by <strong>Obi Wan Kenobi</strong>. He was born on Tatooine by his mom, <strong>Shmi Skywalker</strong>, <br>
                    even though she did not have a partner. Anakin was hoped by many to be <strong>The Chosen One</strong> because of <br>
                    an old prophecy that said <strong>The Chosen One</strong> would bring an end to the Sith and bring balance to the Force. <br>
                    They thought he was <strong>The Chosen One</strong> because the prophecy also said they would be born with no father, and <strong>Anakin</strong> <br>
                    was born without a father and seemingly was a miracle to <strong>Shmi</strong>. He then went on to train as a Jedi before being manipulated by <br>
                    <strong>Palpatine</strong> into joining the Dark side with the promise he could save the ones he loved. A few weeks prior to this, he <br>
                    had visions of his wife, <strong>Padme Amidala</strong>, dying during child birth. He claimed that he wasn't going to let the same <br>
                    thing happen to her when talking about the same thing happened with his mom. In the end, he ended up getting all his limbs cut off, <br>
                    left to burn on the shores of <strong>Mustafar</strong>, and ended up contributing to the death of <strong>Padme</strong>. He then became <br>
                    <strong>Darth Vader</strong>, ruling under <strong>Palpatine</strong> for 23-24 years. He then saw his son, <strong>Luke Skywalker</strong> <br>
                    being tortured by <strong>Palpatine's</strong> devastating Force lightning, so he picked <strong>Palpatine</strong> up and threw <br>
                    him into a Reactor Shaft, killing both <strong>Palpatine</strong> and himself in the process, but ultimately saving his son and <br>
                    bringing balance to the Force.
