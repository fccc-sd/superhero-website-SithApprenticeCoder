            <h2 class="important">About Anakin</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Anakin</strong> was a young boy who was born without a father and, by what <strong>Shmi</strong> <br>
                    would call him, a miracle baby. He was prophesized to be <strong>The Chosen One</strong> and the most powerful <br>
                    Jedi to ever live. He fulfilled the prophecy in Episode 6 when he killed <strong>Palpatine</strong> and <br>
                    by doing that, brought balance to the Force and ended Sith rule throughout the galaxy. <br>

            <h2 class="important">Anakin's Origins</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Anakin</strong> was found as a child with Force sensitivity on <strong>Tatooine</strong>. <br>
                    He was then taken back with the Jedi and trained under <strong>Obi Wan Kenobi</strong> and,  <br>
                    for a while, <strong>Qui Gon Jinn</strong> before he was killed by a Sith named <strong>Darth Maul</strong>. <br>
                    He was trained all the way until he became a Jedi Knight and started thinking the Jedi weren't what they once were. <br>
                    Along with fear, he joined the Dark side and went on to live until the collapse of the Empire, which he had <br>
                    contributed to by killing <strong>Palpatine</strong>, also bringing balance to the Force and <br>
                    fulfilling the prophecy.
